Home sales declined in June as prices hit new all-time high,Sales of existing homes dropped more than expected in June the latest sign that record-high prices and elevated mortgage rates are extending the housing market’s deep freezeYahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports. Boston writes: Read the full story here. After jumping in May sales last month fell 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.93 million according to National Association of Realtors data released on Wednesday. Sales came in worse than expected; economists had forecast a smaller decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million homes. Spring is historically the busiest time of year for home sales but all signs point to 2025 being another subdued year. June sales typically reflect homes that went under contract in April or May — the market’s busy period. But mortgage rates have remained in the high 6% area for much of the year while prices hit a new record straining affordability for buyers even when the labor market and economy look healthy.,,,,,

A clutch of supporting executive orders expected this week could include one that could draw legal challenges notes Yahoo Finance'sAlexis Keenan: Read more here. There may be an order that targets ""woke AI"" according to The Wall Street Journal. It would target AI developers that the administration believes create liberally biased algorithms and block them from serving as federal contractors. ... Two constitutional law scholars who talked with Yahoo Finance said it is doubtful the ""woke AI"" measure will withstand legal scrutiny. ""If you sanction software that is liberal but not software that is conservative the challenge will be that the executive order is content-based discrimination"" said UC San Francisco School of Law professorRory Little. ...

How the dropping dollar could scramble Trump's agenda,"President Trump has said he is ""never going to let the dollar slide."" But his agenda is making that complicated Yahoo Finance'sBen Werschkulreports: Read more here. President Trump and his aides are closely watching the US dollar's (DX=F) drop over the first six months of this year as they track a change that could have wide-ranging effects from how tariffs are felt to Federal Reserve policy to America's role in the world. The question which notably remains a somewhat open one even among Trump's aides is whether the net effects may include at least some positive short-term consequences for the president's agenda or whether the dollar needs to be strengthened at all costs. ... The currency's moves so far this year — which have surprised some economists who expected Trump's tariffs to put pressure in the other direction — could indeed boost exports but could also complicate Trump's goals for the coming months primarily by pushing prices up for US consumers of foreign goods. Trump himself remains very much in the strong dollar camp as hereiterated just a few days ago saying that he is ""never going to let the dollar slide."" The only way that could happen he added is ""if you have a dummy"" as president.

The protein boom is only beginning,"Yahoo Finance'sHamza Shabanreports in today'sMorning Brief: Read more here. They're cramming it into everything now. It's in pancakes and pasta chips and cereal. Plant-based or harvested from the farm it's the macro(nutrient) of the moment. And slices of corporate America are not so subtly asking: Have you met your protein goal today? Protein Doritos sounds like the ideal mashup for the gym rat snack fiends of the world. But it's not as farfetched a product as you might think.

From a profitability standpoint Wall Street analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $0.43 translating to adjusted net income of $1.513 billion down slightly from a year ago. Robotaxi rollout:On the bright side for Tesla is Elon Musk's big bet on the future with robotaxis. Tesla and Musk will most likely focus on that business and this may perhaps point to future rollout plans with more cars and regions. ""The earnings call also presents an opportunity for Tesla's robotaxi/AV narrative to shine which has been front and center of Tesla stock's strength"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to investors.

Trump readies new hands-off AI 'action plan' that offers a split with Biden,"President Trump is expected to release an AI ""action plan"" on Wednesday that reportedly outlines how the US can win in the global race to develop artificial intelligence by fostering a hands-off regulatory approach to the technology.Media reports suggest the document will likely mark a split from Biden administration policies which favored restrictions against exports of AI chips and steps to ensure AI was not used to spread misinformation.The White House according to a Reuters report that cited a summary of the draft action plan will likely discuss how to make it easier to export AI technology abroad and reduce barriers to its development in the US.That may include everything from faster permitting for building AI data centers to more use of AI at the Pentagon to identifying which federal regulations slow down AI and even withholding federal funding from states with tough AI laws already in place.Trump is expected to discuss the topic during a speech at a Wednesday event titled ""Winning the AI Race"" organized by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and his co-hosts on the ""All-In"" podcast.The strategy announcement from the White House is the outcome of an order Trump signed in his first week that asked for an AI action plan to ""sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing economic competitiveness and national security.""FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on AI in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington U.S. January 23 2025.

Microsoft says some SharePoint attackers now using ransomware,"Investing.com-- Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) said on late-Wednesday that some hackers involved in a sweeping attack on its SharePoint service were now using ransomware marking a potential escalation in the security breach.

The company said in a blog post it had identified the deployment of “Warlock” ransomware by a group allegedly tied to China which it calls “Storm-2603.” The group along with two other Chinese hacking groups was allegedly behind a recent attack on SharePoint servers Microsoft had earlier said.

Microsoft’s SharePoint enterprise software was hit with a series of “zero-day” exploits that used previously unknown vulnerabilities which potentially compromised thousands of servers in networks ranging from financial institutions to government organizations.

Nvidia supplier SK Hynix clocks record Q2 profit sees AI demand remaining strong,"Investing.com-- Nvidia memory chip supplierSK Hynix Inc(KS:000660) clocked a record profit for the second quarter on robust demand from the artificial intelligence industry which it expects to remain strong in the coming quarters.

SK Hynix’s operating profit surged 69% to a record high of 9.2 trillion won ($6.69 billion) which was also higher than Reuters estimates of 9 trillion won. Revenue rose 35% to 22.2 trillion won.

The company said that AI-fueled demand continued to boost its earnings while also forecasting a “low likelihood of sharp decline in demand” in the second half of the year.

The chipmaker recently overtook rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) as the world’s biggest memory chip maker thanks largely to its leadership in producing high-bandwith memory chips which are a key component of AI processors.

SK Hynix’s HBM chips are incorporated into Nvidia’s chipsets and are crucial to the large computing and memory requirements of AI models. SK Hynix’s quarterly profit was also well above that forecast by rival Samsung which had earlier in July warned of a bigger-than-expected 56% slide in its second-quarter earnings.

SK Hynix said it will increase its capital expenditure in the face of more customer demand which it sees remaining strong in the remainder of 2025 and 2026.

Still the company faces potential headwinds from U.S. tariffs on semiconductor imports which President Donald Trump has threatened to impose.

Last week SK Hynix was also downgraded to a Neutral rating by Goldman Sachs which cited potential headwinds from increased HBM competition and lower prices for the technology in 2026.",,,,,
Trump said he considered breaking up Nvidia; signs 3 orders to support AI,"Investing.com-- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had considered breaking up NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to boost competition in the artificial intelligence sector but had reconsidered over the difficulty of such a move.

The president outlined a 90-part plan to establish a federal regulatory framework for AI and signed three executive orders incorporating some elements of the plan including looser environmental rules and encouraging more AI exports to allies.

“I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit get them a little competition and I found out it’s not easy in that business” Trump said on Nvidia speaking at an AI summit at the White House.

Trump lauded Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stating “what a job you’ve done!” to the CEO who was present at the summit.

The president spoke on the importance of U.S. dominance in AI and that the country could not allow any foreign nation to surpass the country in the field.

“From this day forward it will be the policy of the United States to lead the world in artificial intelligence” Trump said calling for a “common sense application of artificial and intellectual property rules.”

The president dismissed concerns over the unauthorized use of copyrighted material in training AI a topic that is the subject of several lawsuits against major AI companies especially OpenAI.

Trump also criticized state-based regulation of AI calling for a common federal standard that “supercedes all states.”

As part of Wednesday’s summit Trump signed three executive orders aimed at supporting the AI industry.

He signed an order allowing the use of federally owned land for the development of AI data centers and another order to promote the export of American AI hardware and software.

Trump also signed an order to prevent federal use of politically biased AI claiming that diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) policies posed an “existential threat” to reliable AI.

The orders are mostly in line with a 90-point action plan for the AI industry outlined by Trump which includes a reversal of former President Joe Biden’s gated approach to the industry that called for limited global access to AI.

Trump on the other hand called for a boost to the export of AI technology.",,,,,

Tesla Alphabet earnings on tap

Tesla and Google-owner Alphabet are set to report their second-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday.

The two will be the first among Wall Street’s so-called Magnificent Seven to report this earnings season and are expected to provide broader cues for the market.

Jefferies downgrades Boot Barn on valuation stretch despite solid fundamentals,"Investing.com -- Jefferies downgraded Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Holdings to Hold from Buy saying the stock’s recent run-up leaves limited near-term upside even as the company continues to perform well operationally.

Boot Barn shares are trading at around 24 times forward earnings well above the company’s five-year average of 18x and in line with its +1 standard deviation level Jefferies noted. The firm maintained a $175 price target.

The downgrade reflects valuation concerns rather than any deterioration in fundamentals. Jefferies said demand remains healthy aided by the recent surge in country music popularity and highlighted ongoing customer acquisition and store growth.Exclusive brand penetration and omnichannel initiatives are also seen as positive contributors.

Jefferies raised its first-quarter estimates based on stronger foot traffic and sales data but left second-half forecasts unchanged.Fiscal 2027 EPS is projected at $7.24 above the $7.17 consensus though the firm sees much of the expected growth already reflected in the stock price.

Operating margin is forecast to reach 12.2% in FY2026 close to consensus and slightly below the company’s historical average of 13%.Tariff exposure is expected to decline meaningfully by the second half of the year.

The levy is likely to take effect from August 1 when Trump’s other tariffs against major economies are set to take effect.

This deal saw the Japanese benchmarkNikkeisoar over 3% to the highest level in a year and has raised confidence that an agreement between the U.S. and the European Union can be reached before the August deadline with representatives from the 27-member bloc going to Washington for more talks during this session.

The firm cut its free cash flow estimate for 2026 by 11% and warned the stock is likely to trade flat for the rest of the year due to “a lack of catalysts.”

Lockheed took multiple charges in the quarter across its Aeronautics and Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) divisions.

These included a $950 million pre-tax loss tied to a classified Skunk Works program facing “design integration test challenges and performance issues” and a $570 million charge from the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program.

A further $95 million was booked for the Turkish Utility Helicopter Program and $66 million in write-offs were linked to the U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance decision.

Truist also flagged a “tax overhang of $4.6B” due to a dispute with the IRS. Lockheed has taken a $100 million P&L accrual but “fundamentally disagrees with the grounds for the claim” and is prepared to pursue legal action.",,,,,
Guggenheim upgrades Dynatrace as it sees catalysts building for FY26 growth beat,"Investing.com -- Guggenheim upgraded Dynatrace (NYSE:DT) to Buy from Neutral and set a $66 price target given growing business momentum and a favorable near-term setup as the company enters fiscal 2026.

The firm expects subscription revenue growth of at least 17% in constant currency for the year—above the company’s guidance of 14–15%—driven by stronger-than-expected demand for application performance monitoring (APM) increased adoption of log management and rising customer overages within the company’s consumption-based model.

Recent channel checks showed that multiple partners exceeded targets in the June quarter helped by tool consolidation and expansion activity particularly among large enterprise clients.Guggenheim highlighted early renewals—some triggered by overages of $50000 or more—as a meaningful contributor to deal size uplifts.

Dynatrace’s growing log management business expected to more than double this year to over $100 million in consumption revenue is seen as a major revenue driver.Partners characterized the company’s logs offering as highly competitive in performance and pricing flexibility.

The firm also pointed to improving sales productivity following go-to-market changes in fiscal 2025 with about 30% of reps under one year of tenure now maturing.Management has introduced dedicated teams for key products and aligned compensation incentives with annual recurring revenue growth.

Despite conservative guidance assumptions—including flat year-over-year net new ARR—Guggenheim believes Dynatrace is set up for potential outperformance.The company’s high exposure to secular themes like application modernization observability consolidation and AI integration is also seen as a long-term advantage.",,,,,
Italian government monitoring possible Iveco and Tata deal,"Investing.com -- The Italian government is monitoring news about a possible sale of truckmaker Iveco Group to India’sTata Motors(NYSE:TTM) Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday.

Urso did not mention whether the government might use its ""golden power"" legislation which allows Rome to set conditions on deals involving companies considered strategically important to national interests.

Tata Motors has approached the Agnelli family which controls Iveco through investment company EXOR regarding a potential acquisition of the Italian truck and bus manufacturer according to reports last week.

Iveco shares have surged over 25% since the news emerged last Friday.

Any potential sale would exclude Iveco’s IDV defence business which the group is currently separating through either a spin-off or sale.

Urso emphasized that Rome recognizes the importance of the commercial and industrial vehicle industry particularly Iveco to Italy’s economy and employment.

""Our policy line is clear. We strongly support foreign investments of quality as long as our technology production and jobs are preserved"" Urso stated.

The minister added that the government had agreed to meet with unions about Iveco ""to monitor any developments and if necessary prepare appropriate",,,,,
Canadian rail giants may disrupt bids for Norfolk Southern CSX,"Investing.com -- Speculation in the railroad industry has intensified in recent weeks following reports thatUnion Pacific(NYSE:UNP) is exploring a takeover ofNorfolk Southern(NYSE:NSC). The proposed deal would link a dominant West Coast operator with a major East Coast rival creating a coast-to-coast freight rail powerhouse.

Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena said earlier this year that such a combination could be beneficial for the industry and customers. A deal that was once viewed as implausible is now considered more viable amid expectations of a more permissive regulatory environment under the new Trump administration.

The mounting buzz has put other rail operators on alert. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) the other major East Coast railroad is widely seen as another possible target and recent rumors have suggested that BNSF owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) could be eyeing either CSX or Norfolk Southern.

Also keeping a close watch are Canada’s two dominant railwaysCanadian National Railway(NYSE:CNI) andCanadian PacificKansas City Limited (NYSE:CP). While cross-border regulatory hurdles make it more difficult for these operators to acquire a U.S.-based eastern rail some industry watchers believe the Canadian players could act as spoilers to any proposed deal.

On Monday just as reports surfaced that BNSF had hired Goldman Sachs to explore a possible acquisition—claims later denied by Buffett—Canadian Pacific Kansas City and CSX issued a joint press release. The two companies announced a new east-west freight route called the Southeast Mexico Express which will connect shippers in Mexico Texas and the southeastern U.S. The timing of the announcement raised eyebrows.

Canadian National Railway kicked off rail earnings season on Tuesday. While results disappointed investors focused on management’s commentary around the growing wave of consolidation chatter.

CEO Tracy Robinson acknowledged the speculation but urged caution. In response to a question from TD Cowen analyst Cherilyn Radbourne Robinson said: “We recognize the chatter and are paying attention but it would make no sense for us to speculate on mergers or the intentions of other Class I railroads. We believe similar benefits can be achieved through commercial partnerships without the disruption of a full merger. And the regulatory hurdles are significant and largely untested.”

Later when asked by Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors whether Canadian National would stay on the sidelines or act defensively Robinson added: “We are focused on executing our current plan. That’s the right thing for us now. In any scenario we would rigorously defend our competitive access and growth prospects.”

Representatives for CSX Union Pacific Norfolk Southern BNSF Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City declined to comment.",,,,,
AT&T results: Here's the read-through for Apple,"Investing.com -- AT&T’s second-quarter results offer a modest positive read-through for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) particularly in terms of iPhone unit sales according to analysts at Barclays.

“We estimate AT&T (NYSE:T) sold roughly 3.4M iPhones in the quarter up high teens year-over-year” Barclays wrote.

That performance was “in-line to slightly better than expected” for Apple’s iPhone contribution the analysts said though they noted that upgrade rates remained subdued.

AT&T reported 5.2 million smartphone sales overall for the June quarter with iPhone units likely making up around 7% to 8% of Apple’s total units according to Barclays.

The firm noted that “tariffs may have helped pull in some iPhones for C2Q” suggesting trade dynamics may have had a short-term impact on demand.

Despite a 40-basis-point rise in the upgrade rate year-over-year it remained at 3.3% slightly below the five-year June quarter average of 3.4%.

Barclays said this reflects “continued lengthening of replacement cycle and lower demand.”

Beyond Apple Barclays also highlighted implications for capex-exposed hardware names.

AT&T’s capital expenditures came in at $4.9 billion ahead of the Street’s $4.7 billion forecast. The company also raised its full-year capex guidance to about $22.5 billion and projected annual capital investments of $23–24 billion from 2026 to 2027.

“We view the lifted full-year capex guide positive to mostly neutral to our SP capex-exposed stocks in our coverage” Barclays said namingCiena(NYSE:CIEN) Corning (NYSE:GLW) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) as key beneficiaries.

The analysts added that they “expect telcos’ ongoing fiber expansions to be lumpy for GLW though we expect sustained accelerated recovery for SPs for the year into 2026.”",,,,,
Tyson Foods downgraded on beef margin pressure and peak chicken profitability,"Investing.com -- Bernstein downgradedTyson Foods(NYSE:TSN) to Market-Perform from Outperform warning of continued headwinds in the company’s beef segment and limited upside in its chicken business ahead of third-quarter results.

The brokerage lowered its price target to $59 from $74 citing reduced EBITDA forecasts and a lower valuation multiple.Bernstein said profitability remains the central concern especially in beef where supply constraints disease risks and trade uncertainties are weighing on margins.

Tyson’s beef margins are expected to remain negative in the near term. EBIT margins are expected to be between -1.5% and -1.0% for the quarter a slight improvement from consensus of -2.6%.Still cattle supplies remain historically tight with heifer slaughter rates too high to support herd rebuilding. Additional pressure has emerged from the spread of New World screwworms which has led to repeated closures of the U.S.-Mexico cattle import corridor a key supply source.

Bernstein also flagged policy risks including scrutiny of Australian beef imports under the Trump administration which may further limit supply flexibility.

In chicken performance remains solid but may be nearing a ceiling. Bernstein said recent gains driven by plant closures better genetics and improved forecasting may have pushed the vertically integrated segment to peak margins.While demand is healthy management has signaled limited pricing power due to chicken’s role as a lower-cost protein.

Pork margins remain under pressure from higher hog costs while Prepared Foods faces input cost inflation despite recent operational improvements.

Bernstein warned the broader protein industry faces structural and policy uncertainties and that Tyson’s near-term margin outlook remains fragile despite some tailwinds in chicken and efficiency initiatives in Prepared Foods.",,,,,
Unity share improvement overstates fundamental benefit of ad model upgrade: BTIG,"Investing.com -- In a note to clients on Wednesday BTIG downgraded Unity shares to Sell from Neutral arguing that the stock’s recent rally up more than 40% month-to-date “overstates the fundamental benefit from an ad model upgrade.”

In the note published ahead of Unity’s earnings report on August 6 BTIG analysts said the improvement driven by Vector Unity’s upgraded advertising solution has already been priced in.

“A mark-to-market suggests shares may already reflect a level of success with both Vector and future Create opportunities” the team wrote.

While acknowledging some progress BTIG said it does not justify the extent of the stock’s recent gains.

“Vector [is] improving but not enough to justify [the] MTD run” the note stated.

The analysts said Unity’s outlook depends more heavily on the longer-term trajectory of its core operations.

“Success for Unity should be defined by the company’s ability to recapture a podium position in the gaming UA market and evolution of the Create business over a multi-year timeframe” BTIG wrote.

The firm credited CEO Matt Bromberg with stabilizing the company after the controversial 2023–24 runtime fee changes saying he “has done an admirable job of repairing developer relationships.”

Still BTIG believes that even with potential upside in Create the stock has likely run too far ahead of fundamentals.

BTIG set a $25 price target on the stock implying downside from current levels.

“We see potential for incremental growth opportunities” the firm added. However they believe shares may already reflect much of that upside.",,,,,
Citi initiates Celsius at Buy on category growth global expansion potential,"Investing.com -- Citi initiated coverage ofCelsius Holdings(NASDAQ:CELH) with a Buy rating and a $55 price target given strong near-term momentum in the U.S. energy drink market and long-term international growth opportunities.

Citi expects Celsius to benefit from accelerating sales in 2025 helped by both its core Celsius brand and the recently acquired Alani Nu which is expanding distribution and product innovation.The firm projects second-quarter sales growth of 66.4% ahead of the 60.7% consensus and full-year 2025 growth of 63.8%.

In the longer term Citi sees room for substantial distribution gains. The company’s total distribution points (TDPs) remain significantly below those of Monster and Red Bull offering room for domestic share gains.Internationally Celsius derives just 5% of its revenue from outside the U.S. compared with roughly 40% for Monster suggesting meaningful white space.

Citi forecasts 12% annual topline growth through 2030 including 25% growth internationally and sees 25% annual EPS growth over the same period supported in part by cost synergies from the Alani Nu deal.

While acknowledging concerns around valuation Celsius trades at about 36 times 2026 earnings—Citi argues the stock looks more reasonable on a growth-adjusted basis with a PEG ratio of 1.2 versus peer averages near 2.6.

Risks noted include potential volatility between scanner data and reported results innovation-driven growth that may be harder to sustain overlap between the Celsius and Alani brands and already-positive investor sentiment.Still Citi believes distribution expansion and brand differentiation can offset those concerns.",,,,,
Roblox: Raymond James sees merit in bull case but notes 'very high bar for 2Q',"Investing.com -- Raymond James downgraded Roblox shares to Outperform from Strong Buy on Wednesday citing a sharp run-up in the stock and rising expectations that create a “very high bar” heading into second-quarter earnings.

While remaining constructive the firm’s analysts acknowledged the risks around Roblox’s viral hit Grow A Garden which has helped drive a 74% rally in the share price since the day after first-quarter results.

“The rapid rise over the course of 2Q and the expectations increase that comes with it drives us to take a slight step back to Outperform” the team wrote.

Despite the downgrade Raymond James continues to see “merit in the bull case.”

Analysts highlighted several positive signs including that Grow A Garden is “bringing in new users” is “not the only new experience gaining traction” and that user growth and retention metrics are improving across the platform.

“Taken together while Grow A Garden is certainly helping matters [it shows] that the platform can be in good shape even if it declines” they said.

However the firm also flagged concerns about the durability of viral hits and the risk of disappointment when expectations are high.

“The rate of estimate increases suggests that even an incredibly strong number will only be rewarded modestly while any meaningful shortfall could be punished severely” the note warned.

Raymond James raised its price target for the stock to $130 from $81 based on 13.5x its 2026 EV/bookings estimate which it says reflects tangible growth rather than “metaverse-driven” hype.

Despite the valuation reset analysts expect a “more measured advance going forward but an advance nonetheless.”",,,,,
Jefferies starts Galaxy Digital with Buy rating on data center cash flows,"Investing.com -- Jefferies has initiated coverage onGalaxy Digital(TSX:GLXY) with a Buy rating and a $35 price target given a stable long-term cash flows from its AI data center operations and a more supportive regulatory outlook for digital assets.

Galaxy founded in 2018 operates across digital asset trading asset management and infrastructure.While initially focused onBitcoinmining the company has shifted toward AI data center development notably through its Helios site.

A key driver is Galaxy’s lease agreements with CoreWeave totaling 393 megawatts (MW) of capacity at Helios.Jefferies expects these contracts to generate $900 million in revenue at margins nearing 90% providing significant cash flow to fund further expansion.An option for an additional 133 MW remains outstanding while management has indicated the site could scale up to 1.7 gigawatts of gross power capacity.

Jefferies estimates the current leases account for roughly $13 per share in value with future capacity potentially worth another $6.90 per share if executed under similar terms.

The firm also points to Galaxy’s digital asset business as well-positioned for growth helped by recent legislative developments such as the GENIUS Act.Jefferies values this segment at $10.80 per share using a valuation multiple that reflects its broad scope compared to more narrowly focused crypto firms.

Roughly two-thirds of Jefferies’ valuation stems from the data center business with the remainder tied to digital asset management and trading.",,,,,
Morgan Stanley Humanoid 100 list up 11.1% since inception outperforming indices,"Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley said its Humanoid 100 list has risen 11.1% on an equal-weighted basis since its launch on February 6 significantly outperforming several major benchmarks including theS&P 500 which gained 3.5% over the same period.

The Humanoid 100 is Morgan Stanley’s list of stocks most exposed to the AI-enabled robotics theme.

“The Humanoid 100 list is up 11.1% since inception outperforming a number of major indices” the firm wrote noting it has outperformed theMSCI Europeand MSCI Taiwan indices but trailedMSCI Chinaand Korea.

Top contributors included rare earths video game and semiconductor names.

“All 4 of the rare earths companies included in the list... are among the top performers” Morgan Stanley said citing “rising rare earth prices and a market recognition of the critical nature of the long-standing rare earth bottleneck.”

MP Materials led all stocks up 145% since the list’s inception after securing a deal and investment from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Unity a recent addition also ranked among the top performers following a rebound in its advertising business.

However not all sectors fared equally. “Bottom performers are dominated by Asia-based industrial stocks facing a reset in robotics expectations” the analysts said.

This group includes Harmonic (NASDAQ:HLIT) Drive Systems Rainbow Robotics Tuopu and Hiwin Technologies which according to the bank were initially lifted by enthusiasm in early 2025 sparked by events like Elon Musk’s comments on Tesla’s Optimus robot and Unitree’s appearance at the Chinese New Year Gala.

U.S.-Japan trade deal reached...Will Korea be the next?,"Investing.com -- The United States and Japan on Tuesday finalized what President Donald Trump called “the largest trade deal in history.”

Under the agreement Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and its exports to the American market—ranging from vehicles to agricultural goods—will be taxed at 15% down from the 25% tariff previously threatened.

Trump said the pact would open Japan’s market to U.S. cars trucks and farm products and hailed the agreement as a win for both nations.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba welcomed the deal highlighting that it brought Japanese trade surplus tariffs to their “lowest figure to date.”

He added that U.S. tariffs on cars and parts would be cut to 15% though this remains above the 10% rate seen during the temporary suspension of higher tariffs earlier this year.

The trade deal has prompted questions among analysts about whether South Korea could be next.

Bank of America (BofA) said that both Japan and Korea share similar trade dynamics with the U.S. including high current account surpluses significant auto exports to the U.S. and relatively closed domestic markets.

“Given the U.S.-Japan deal made today if the negotiation goes smoothly we see more likelihood that a similar deal could be reached between U.S. and Korea” said BofA’s China & Korea Economist Benson Wu pointing to the possibility of a 15% reciprocal tariff structure.

BofA also outlined potential concessions from the Korean side such as increased foreign direct investment (FDI) in semiconductors autos and other high-tech sectors along with greater imports of U.S. energy and agricultural products. However certain items like rice and beef remain sensitive.

Separately Macquarie analysts said that if Korean automakers receive the same 15% tariff treatment as Japan it would limit downside risk to earnings.

“Our tariff sensitivity analysis finds that each 1%p decline in tariff leads to a 1.6% gain in operating profit (OP) on our current estimates” which assume a 25% tariff with mitigation efforts in place.

“We expect that a 15% tariff on a par with the Japanese rate would limit year-over-year OP decline risk” they added.

The broker estimates that at the 25% level Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) Motor (KS:005380) and Kia Corp (KS:000270) face tariffs of over $6200 per vehicle—higher thanToyota(NYSE:TM)Honda(NYSE:HMC) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) which pay between $4200 and $5600 per unit.

The firm notes that tariffs had been a major overhang for Asian automakers and that removing this uncertainty could support a valuation re-rating. However it cautioned that broader import tariffs may still impact affordability as costs are passed on to consumers.

Macquarie sees Hyundai as a key U.S. market share gainer supported by its growing hybrid vehicle lineup.",,,,,
Could CCL stock double in value again? Morgan Stanley weighs in,"Investing.com -- Carnival Corp. could double in value from current levels under a bullish scenario according to Morgan Stanley which raised its price target on the cruise operator to $30 from $24 in a note Wednesday.

Morgan Stanley said it sees scope for a major rerating across cruise stocks helped by slowing capacity growth improving products such as private islands and favourable fuel and currency trends.

“Our new bull cases suggest CCL could double again ($60)” the analysts wrote. They added: “CCL has implemented some bold and sensible actions to rationalise its fleet focusing on its highest returning brands and boosting the eponymous Carnival (NYSE:CCL) brand with Celebration Key.”

The firm sees Carnival offering “catch-up potential” on both revenue and margins noting the company is “only just back to FY19 margins which were themselves depressed relative to FY16-18.”

Morgan Stanley also pointed to rapid deleveraging at Carnival helped by a limited new ship pipeline. “Leverage to fall from 4.5x in FY24 to 3.8x in FY25e to 3.0x in FY26e after when it should be back to investment grade” the note said.

While the analysts kept an Equal-weight rating due to downside risks in a recession scenario they highlighted the stock’s upside potential.

“If we benchmark CCL against the best-in-class KPIs of its peers... $4 of EPS is feasible and 15x P/E gives a $60/4400p bull case.”

Morgan Stanley concluded: “CCL offers the most exciting upside potential for investors who believe in ongoing yield strength and operational outperformance.”",,,,,
Jefferies downgrades Vimian to “hold” on MedTech struggles CEO exit,"Investing.com -- Jefferies has downgradedVimian Group AB(ST:VIMIAN) to a “hold” from “buy” rating citing sustained underperformance in its MedTech division and recent leadership instability in a note dated Wednesday.

The brokerage also cut its price target from SEK 50 to SEK 40 reflecting lowered financial estimates and increased execution risk.

MedTech which accounts for 35% of Vimian’s revenue remains a major drag on group performance.

Organic growth in the segment is now forecast to decline by 1% in the second half of 2025 with a slow recovery expected due to weak U.S. market conditions and limited visibility into a rebound.

Overall group organic growth is projected to fall to 5% in 2025 from 9% in 2024. Group adjusted EBITA margin is expected to decline to 24.6% from 25.4% over the same period.

Recent executive changes have further clouded visibility. CEO Patrik Eriksson’s abrupt departure has placed CFO Carl-Johan Zetterberg Boudrie in the role of interim CEO.

Meanwhile MedTech head Guy Spörri will leave by year-end with Veterinary Services chief Ali Tajbakhsh named as interim replacement.

Jefferies views these changes as reactive and aimed at course correction but said they introduce near-term uncertainty.

The downgrade follows a mixed Q2 print and what analysts called “ongoing underperformance” in orthopedics.

Jefferies revised its EPS forecasts down by 13% for 2025 6% for 2026 and 5% for 2027.

The updated price target of SEK 40 based on a DCF model implies a 21x 2026E EV/EBIT multiple compared with Vimian’s historical average of 25x.

According to Jefferies 70% of the target reduction is due to weaker MedTech expectations while 30% stems from a higher WACC tied to elevated execution risk.

Despite challenges in MedTech the company’s other three business segments Specialty Pharma Diagnostics and Veterinary Services are expected to post high single-digit to low double-digit growth in 2025 with stable to improving margins.

However analysts noted these areas are unlikely to offset the drag from MedTech in the near term.

Vimian’s earnings per share are now projected at €0.09 for 2025 flat year-over-year with growth of 27% and 21% expected in 2026 and 2027 respectively. The stock last closed at SEK 35.66 implying a 12% upside to the revised target.

Jefferies stated that further signs of commercial traction in MedTech particularly in U.S. orthopedics and permanent executive appointments would be needed to revisit a more constructive view.",,,,,

Doughnut chainKrispy Kreme(NASDAQ:DNUT) surged 33% building on its near 27% gain on Tuesday. Between 15% to 30% of Krispy Kreme’s outstanding tradable shares are currently shorted according to recent data from multiple sources.

Camera maker GoPro rocketed about 47% to $2.01 with short interest at between 8% to 10%. Plant-based meat producer Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) jumped 10.4% with short interest standing at over 35%.

Morgan Stanley names Northrop and RTX as Top Picks in defense and aerospace,"Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley has namedNorthrop Grumman(NYSE:NOC) and RTX Corp its new Top Picks in the defense and aerospace sectors respectively citing improved program economics and compelling valuations.

The firm upgraded Northrop Grumman to its “Top Pick in Defense” and raised its price target to $625 from $570.

Analysts cited strong second-quarter results and improved prospects for the company’s B-21 Raider bomber program.

“The potential for improved B-21 economics as the Air Force looks to accelerate aircraft production is significant in our view” Morgan Stanley wrote.

The bank said Northrop’s marquee programs appear well-funded with the B-21 receiving approximately $4.5 billion in reconciliation funding and the E-2D aircraft securing an additional $1.5 billion.

The firm added “We see acceleration in Northrop’s revenue growth with improving margins” and called the company’s portfolio “Best in Breed.”

In a separate note RTX was named Morgan Stanley’s “Top Pick in Aerospace.”

The bank said that despite lowering its 2025 earnings outlook due to tariffs RTX is trading at a steep discount to peers like GE Aerospace about 33% on a next-twelve-month price-to-free-cash-flow basis and 40% on EV/EBITDA.

“We see current valuation levels as compelling” the analysts wrote. “The market is disproportionately penalizing RTX creating a relative value opportunity and an attractive entry point.”

RTX beat second-quarter expectations with both revenue and segment profit exceeding estimates.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $180 from $165 and maintained its Overweight rating noting strong demand across RTX’s end markets and ongoing progress in managing its GTF engine fleet.",,,,,
RBC upgrades Sartorius stocks as recent pullback 'provides entry opportunity',"Investing.com -- RBC Capital Markets has upgraded its ratings on bothSartorius AG(ETR:SATG) and SartoriusStedim(EPA:STDM) to Outperform from Sector Perform highlighting the recent share price weakness as an opportunity to re-enter the names.

The brokerage believes that the roughly 14% pullback over the past two months has improved the risk-reward balance for both stocks.

“Underperformance over the last two months has swung the risk-reward to the upside” analysts led by Charles Weston said in a Wednesday note noting that the negative reaction to Sartorius’ recent in-line results contributed to the move lower.

While bioprocessing trends remain steady—with strong demand for consumables and persistently weak instrument sales—RBC sees room for upside if equipment demand recovers. Currently equipment sales are acting as a drag of more than two percentage points on group sales.

“We don’t know when this will recover but when it does we would expect it to turn to a >2ppt tailwind driving earnings upside and multiple expansion” the analysts said.

RBC trimmed its price target for Sartorius AG to €250 from €260 reflecting slightly adjusted estimates including tariff-related revenue adjustments and modest earnings per share (EPS) downgrades for 2026 and 2027.

The firm values Sartorius AG based on its 71.5% stake in Sartorius Stedim and an additional valuation for the Lab Products division offset by higher debt levels.

Despite ongoing concerns around biotech funding tariffs and pricing pressure in pharma analysts believe sentiment could turn on signs of equipment recovery.

Although Q2 results were broadly in line the stock experienced “significant intraday volatility around messaging on order levels” they said.

RBC sees nearly 30% upside in Sartorius shares on a one-year view supported by the potential for a rebound in equipment demand and stabilizing market sentiment.

In the wake of recent share price decline the team believes that investors ""have an opportunity to re-build their holdings at this level.”",,,,,
Bessent says EU talks improving Japan got 15% tariff due to innovation,"Investing.com -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that U.S. talks with the European Union ""are going better than they had been"" while noting that Japan secured a lower 15% auto tariff rate by proposing an innovative financing package.

In a Bloomberg TV interview Bessent explained that Japan’s reduced tariff rate came after the country offered a creative solution involving ""partnership equity and credit guarantees"" as part of its foreign direct investment pledge which he described as ""all new capital.""

When asked if the EU could secure a similar 15% tariff rate instead of the proposed 25% Bessent emphasized that Japan’s rate was specifically tied to its innovative approach suggesting the EU would need to propose something comparable.

Bessent characterized the EU’s preparation of retaliatory measures as a negotiating tactic adding ""I would do the same if I were in EU place.""

Regarding China the Treasury Secretary said the U.S. is ""in a good place"" and can ""move on to bigger talks"" noting it’s ""not sustainable"" for China to make up 30% of global manufacturing. He stressed the U.S. doesn’t want decoupling from China but rather ""supply de-risking.""

On Federal Reserve matters Bessent said there are ""a lot of strong Fed candidates including on the board"" and at regional banks though he wouldn’t discuss specific names or the nomination process for the next chair. He added that the administration is ""not in a rush"" on Fed chair nomination and confirmed his regular meetings with current Chair Jerome Powell continue.

Bessent also criticized the Fed’s analysis of tariffs as ""a bit off"" and suggested the central bank should conduct an internal review of its policies possibly using an outside panel similar to what the Bank of England has done in the past.",,,,,
Soitec shares slide as Q2 guidance 'materially below consensus',"Investing.com -- Soitec shares are under pressure on Wednesday currently down more than 6% after the semiconductor materials company issued second-quarter guidance that Bernstein described as ""materially below consensus.""

Soitec(EPA:SOIT) reported first-quarter revenue of €92 million 1% below consensus expectations.

While the year-over-year decline of 16% on a like-for-like basis was slightly better than the company’s forecast of a 20% drop the results were dragged down by weakness in its Mobile Communications segment.

That unit came in 6% below expectations declining 7% on a like-for-like basis due to “foundry inventory reductions” Bernstein said.

These losses were partly offset by strength in Edge and Cloud which beat consensus by 6% and grew 13% year-over-year helped by “very strong Photonics-SOI that more than offset the roll-off of Imager-SOI” Bernstein noted.

However Soitec’s second-quarter guidance disappointed. The company forecasts a 50% sequential increase in revenue implying second-quarter revenue of €140 million down 36% from a year earlier and 19% below consensus.

Bernstein attributed the shortfall to “stronger-than-expected foundry de-stocking reflecting macroeconomic/global trade uncertainties (US tariffs)” as well as a weaker smartphone outlook and “continued misery in automotive end-markets.”

Bernstein expects the guidance to prompt cuts to full-year expectations: “We expect consensus to cut FY26 revenue expectations by at least €34m (-4.2%)… likely in the -5% to -8% range implying FY26 EPS cuts of over 10%.”

Bernstein had warned in its note (released on Tuesday) that Soitec’s latest update “may result in significant pressure on Soitec shares in tomorrow’s trade (a 10% or worse fall seems in order in our view).”",,,,,
SAP clients reviewing cloud services spending amid tariff risks CEO tells WSJ,"Investing.com - SAP (ETR:SAPG) is seeing some clients take longer to subscribe to its cloud services due to wariness around sweeping U.S. tariffs CEO Christian Klein has said.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Klein flagged that the caution was apparent in industries like auto manufacturing which is considered to be particularly exposed to President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff agenda. Carmakers are now facing a 25% levy on finished vehicles made overseas imported into the United States.

Klein added that although SAP has ""strong momentum"" it remains ""really hard to predict how the second half will unfold.""

Germany-listed shares in SAP (ETR:SAPG) fell by more than 3% on Wednesday after the information technology group posted better-than-anticipated quarterly profit and sales but opted not to lift its full-year outlook disappointing some investors hoping for a guidance raise.

For the three months ended June 30 the German software manufacturerreportedadjusted earnings of 1.50 euros per share on revenue of 9.03 billion euros above consensus estimates of 1.43 euros and 9.09 billion euros respectively.

Cloud revenue jumped 24% versus a year ago to 5.13 billion euros in the second quarter slowing from a 27% uptick in the prior quarter and 25% in the corresponding period in 2024.

Looking ahead SAP said it expects 2025 outlook adjusted operating profit to between 10.3 billion euros and 10.6 billion euros unchanged from its prior projections. A year earlier it stood at 8.15 billion euros.

SAP said it was facing ""elevated levels of uncertainty and reduced visibility"" with CFO Dominik Asam flagging that the business was keeping close tabs on ""geopolitical developments and public sector trends.""

EU said to plan 30% tariffs on $117 billion of US goods if Trump imposes levies,"Investing.com -- The European Union is preparing to impose 30% tariffs on approximately €100 billion ($117 billion) worth of US goods if no deal is reached and if US President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to place that rate on most EU exports after August 1 according to a report from Bloomberg.

The European Commission spokesman announced Wednesday that as part of an initial wave of countermeasures the EU would combine an already approved list of tariffs on €21 billion of US goods with a previously proposed list covering an additional €72 billion of American products into a single package.

The targeted US exports would include industrial goods such asBoeing Co(NYSE:BA). aircraft US-manufactured cars and bourbon whiskey. These items would face a levy matching Trump’s threatened 30% tariff the report noted citing sources familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.

The EU tariffs would be ready to take effect next month but would only be implemented if no agreement is reached and the US proceeds with its levies after the August deadline.

EU member states including Germany have taken harder positions as the US has toughened its negotiating stance. Berlin would reportedly support activating the EU’s anti-coercion instrument (ACI) if no deal materializes according to a German government official speaking anonymously.",,,,,
Amazon stock target raised at BofA on expected Q2 retail beat,"Investing.com -- Bank of America raised its price target for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares to $265 from $248 in a note Wednesday maintaining a Buy rating on the stock.

The bank cited expectations of a second-quarter retail beat and potential acceleration in Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth in the second half of the year.

Amazon is scheduled to report earnings on July 31. Bank of America said it has ""slightly raise[d] estimates for strong 2Q retail data FX and Anthropic AI growth"" forecasting revenue of $164 billion ahead of the $162 billion consensus.

The firm also expects second-quarter profit of $17.8 billion topping both the Street estimate of $17.0 billion and the high end of Amazon’s own guidance at $17.5 billion.

BofA said its internal credit and debit card data alongside Bloomberg Second Measure point to a stronger-than-expected retail performance.

“We therefore expect Amazon N.A. to beat Street estimates by 2%+” analysts wrote.

In international markets the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the second quarter should provide a lift.

“The Euro was up 5% y/y and 8% q/q vs the US$ which should aid International revenues” BofA said.

The firm expects Amazon to guide third-quarter revenue in the $169 billion to $174 billion range with GAAP EBIT guidance between $14.0 billion and $18.0 billion below the Street’s $19.4 billion forecast.

BofA also noted “recent reports of AWS job cuts… which could aid 2H margins.”

“AWS key stock driver in 2H‘25” BofA said pointing to strong AI demand backlog momentum and increased capex.

Despite trading at 13.4x 2026 EV/EBITDA the firm believes Amazon has “multiple expansion potential.”",,,,,
U.S. automakers edge higher premarket after U.S.-Japan trade deal announcement,"Investing.com - U.S. automakers were broadly higher in premarket trading on Wednesday after their global peers climbed on optimism around a new trade deal between the U.S. and Japan.

Shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) gained 1.7% paring back some of sharp loss in the prior session that was sparked by tariff-hit earnings from the company. Rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) edged up by 0.2% while electric car giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) -- which is due to report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell -- rose marginally by 0.3%.

In Europe automotive stocks rallied. Milan-listed shares of Jeep-maker Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) rose along with Germany’s Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) Mercedes Benz (ETR:MBGn) BMW (ETR:BMWG) and Porsche.Renault(EPA:RENA) was also higher despite posting no growth in second-quarter sales volume.

The increases came after steep jumps in the shares of several Japanese car groups.Toyota(NYSE:TM) Motor (TYO:7203) led the rally with a 14% surge whileHonda(NYSE:HMC) Motor (TYO:7267) spiked by over 11%. Nissan (TYO:7201) rallied roughly 8% while Mazda (TYO:7261) rose nearly 17%.

South Korean peers strengthened too with Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) Motor (KS:005380) up 7.5% and Kia Corp (KS:000270) adding 8.5% as investors speculated that Seoul may secure trade terms near to those made with Japan.

The stock moves came after President Donald Trump announced his administration had completed a “massive deal” with Japan which will see the Asian country face a 15% tariff. Crucially Japan’s all-important auto industry which accounts for over a quarter of the country’s exports to the U.S. will see its levies set the same rate.

Trump added that Japan will invest $550 billion into the U.S. of which the U.S. will “receive 90% of the Profits.”

“Japan will open their Country to Trade including Cars and Trucks Rice and certain other Agricultural Products and other things. Japan will pay Reciprocal Tariffs to the United States of 15%” he said in a social media post.

The deal -- one of the most significant of a series of preliminary trade pacts since Trump first unveiled his heightened global levies in April -- comes after reports said Japan’s top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa met Trump in the White House on Tuesday.

While the 15% tariff is lower than the 25% initially outlined by Trump it still goes against Tokyo’s earlier demands that Japan be exempt from all U.S. tariffs.

""The trade deal with the U.S. announced today removes a key downside risk to Japan’s economy"" analsyts at Capital Economics said in a note to clients. ""We estimate that the net effect of today’s announcement will be a reduction in the average tariff rate faced by Japanese exporters in the US of around one percentage point.""

Beyond Japan the direction of negotiations with other major U.S. trading partners such as the European Union and India remains unclear with an August 1 deadline for Trump’s elevated ""reciprocal"" tariffs to take effect fast approaching.

Still ""success in obtaining some agreement at this time hence should have a substantial effect in mitigating concerns about future uncertainty"" analysts at Jefferies said in a note.",,,,,
Banco BPM shares slide as UniCredit drops takeover bid over regulatory block,"Investing.com -- Banco BPM (BIT:BAMI) shares were down over 2% on Wednesday after UniCredit on Tuesday withdrew its voluntary public exchange offer for all of the bank’s ordinary shares citing unresolved regulatory barriers tied to Italy’s Golden Power rules.

UniCredit stated that its decision followed the failure to obtain the necessary Golden Power authorization a condition the bank explicitly declined to waive.

According to the statement BPM leadership’s insistence on invoking Golden Power provisions prevented UniCredit from engaging directly with BPM shareholders.

The lack of shareholder dialogue hindered the ability to assess the value of the proposed combination or explore acceptable terms.

UniCredit noted progress in discussions with the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition and the Italian government.

However it said the timeline for resolving the Golden Power issue extended beyond the offer deadline and even beyond the suspension of the offer announced by CONSOB.

In withdrawing the offer UniCredit framed the failed process as a setback not only for BPM’s shareholders but also for Italian financial sector consolidation efforts.

“The UniCredit-Banco BPM tie-would have added massive value for all concerned.  The derailed offer process and continued uncertainty has made this situation untenable” said UniCredit chairman Pietro Carlo Padoan in a statement.

Chief executive Andrea Orcel added “The continued uncertainty around the application of the Golden Power prescriptions do not benefit either” reinforcing that the withdrawal was aimed at protecting UniCredit’s shareholders.

While the bank reaffirmed its broader support for consolidation in Italy and Europe it emphasized that mergers and acquisitions remain secondary to its core strategy.

Orcel said UniCredit’s priority remains executing its ongoing transformation program which the bank claims is delivering results ahead of expectations.

The offer was initially launched on a non-discriminatory basis targeting all ordinary shareholders of Banco BPM. BPM’s shares are listed on theEuronext(EPA:ENX) Milan operated by Borsa Italiana.

However legal constraints imposed by the Golden Power provisions limited the offer’s execution.

These provisions typically used by the Italian government to protect strategic industries require prior approval before foreign or domestic entities can acquire significant stakes in certain companies.

UniCredit made clear it would not proceed with the offer without regulatory certainty.

The bank said it would not pursue similar transactions unless they clearly enhance shareholder value and align with its strategic direction.",,,,,
Nokia shares drop after network gear maker slashes outlook due partly to tariffs,"Investing.com - Helsinki-listed shares in Nokia (HE:NOKIA) fell by 7% on Wednesday after the Finnish telecoms group slashed its annual income outlook due to tariff-fueled headwinds and recent weakness in the U.S. dollar.

Although sales in its key North American market have been growing steadily Nokia has been grappling with sweeping U.S. levies which threaten to lead many clients and customers to rein in spending.

""Considering currency and tariff headwinds which are outside its control and have transpired since its Q1 results the company feels it is prudent at this point to lower its operating profit outlook range"" Nokia said in a statement.

In a statement after the close of European markets on Tuesday Nokia cut its comparable operating profit guidance range to 1.6 billion euros to 2.1 billion euros down from a prior estimate of 1.9 billion euros to 2.4 billion euros.

The network equipment manufacturer added that tariffs would dent the outlook by 50 million euros to 80 million euros while currency fluctuations especially in the guise of a faltering greenback would impact results by around 230 million euros. Nokia flagged that the new guidance was based on a euro exchange rate of $1.17 versus $1.04 used previously in January.

Meanwhile Nokia reported preliminary second-quarter comparable operating profit of 300 million euros on net sales of 4.55 billion. Analysts at Jefferies said this represents an operating margin of 6.6% for the quarter.

Consensus estimates had called for a margin of 8.4% and revenue of 4.81 billion euros. Nokia’s full results are expected to be released on Thursday.

""While the currency and tariff hit is understandable we believe the underlying business itself is also relatively sluggish at present"" the Jefferies analysts said.",,,,,
Temenos shares soar 18% after strong beat-and-raise Q2,"Investing.com -- Swiss enterprise software firm Temenos (SIX:TEMN) saw its shares soar more than 18% on Wednesday after it reported a surprisingly strong second quarter rebounding from a softer first quarter with solid revenue growth and a significant earnings beat.

Group revenue rose 17% year-on-year in constant currency coming in 13.4% above consensus.

Total software licensing revenue reached $124.9 million up 24% year-on-year and 25% ahead of expectations.

Annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 11% accelerating from 9% growth in the previous quarter.

Operating profit jumped 28% in constant currency with EBIT landing 37.4% above consensus and the EBIT margin rising to 40.2% well above the expected 33.2%.

Free cash flow grew 8% to $65 million slightly ahead of the consensus estimate.

Following a strong second quarter Temenos raised its full-year guidance across revenue EBIT and EPS. The company now expects ARR growth of over 12% in constant currency while Subscription & SaaS revenue is projected to grow “at least 6%.”

Adjusted EBIT growth is now guided above 9% in constant currency up from over 5% previously and adjusted EPS is expected to rise 10–12% compared to the earlier 7–9% range.

""After a challenging Q1 Temenos has delivered a strong beat and raise outperforming the company’s own Q225 guidance"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Wood said in a note.

""While the implied FY25 upgrade is modest we’d expect the stock to be up low teens % given low expectations into the quarter"" he added.

Separately Bank of America analysts noted that despite a strong second quarter the modest increase in Temenos’ 2025 guidance suggests a ""prudent"" outlook for the second half (H2).

The company’s subscription and SaaS revenue grew 12% in the first half compared to full-year guidance of over 6%. This analysts say implies H2 growth of around 3.5%.

Similarly the upgraded EBIT guidance of over 9% suggests second-half growth of just over 4% following a 19% increase in the first half BofA’s team noted.

""TEMN continues to execute on its strategic roadmap with commercial traction and U.S. expansion strategy on track but we remain prudent mid term on demand uncertainty"" the analysts said.

BofA reiterated its Neutral rating on the stock and lifted its price target to CHF73 from CHF71.",,,,,

ASM International sinks as Q2 new orders fall 4% amid mixed market conditions,"Investing.com -- ASM International reported a 4% year-on-year decline in new orders in the second quarter of 2025 as mixed market conditions weighed on demand across segments. The company’s shares sank 8.5% in Amsterdam trading on Wednesday.

New orders fell to €702.5 million at constant currencies down 10% from the first quarter largely due to lower advanced logic/foundry bookings.

The company added that the “y-o-y decrease was mainly due to the lumpy nature of quarterly order intake and compared to a relatively high memory contribution in Q2 2024.”

“The market environment continued to show a mixed picture in the second quarter” said ASM CEO Hichem M’Saad.

While AI-related demand supported growth in leading-edge logic/foundry and HBM-related DRAM other segments remained sluggish.

Despite the drop in bookings revenue rose 23% year-on-year at constant currencies to €835.6 million outperforming ASM’s prior guidance.

Foundry led sales followed by memory and logic with China also contributing more than expected.

Gross margin came in at 51.8% down from Q1’s 53.4% but above the 49.8% margin recorded a year earlier.

Operating profit rose to €258.5 million with adjusted net earnings reaching €173 million. The company also booked a €34 million reversal of a prior impairment on its stake in ASMPT as market valuations improved.

Looking ahead ASM expects third-quarter revenue to be flat or slightly lower than Q2 with a book-to-bill ratio projected below one. This suggests that ""orders will remain below Q1 levels in Q3 having been below Q1 levels in Q2 already"" said JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande.

Full-year revenue growth is forecast to land around the midpoint of the 10% to 20% guidance range with strong sales in the 2nm GAA logic/foundry node expected to remain a key driver.

China’s equipment sales are now projected to hit the upper end of the previously forecast range though bookings there are expected to decline in the second half.

While full-year 2025 (FY25) estimates may remain unchanged after the results ""FY26 estimates will need to decline"" said Deshpande.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a ""massive"" U.S.–Japan deal cutting planned tariffs on Japanese goods including autos to 15% from a proposed 25%. The reduction removes a major cost burden on outbound carmakers and improves export prospects.

Japan’sNikkei 225soared 3.5% to a one-year high powered by sharp gains in carmakers.

Telix Pharma slides 10% on SEC probe into cancer treatment,"Investing.com-- Australian shares of Telix Pharmaceuticals Ltd (ASX:TLX) fell sharply on Wednesday after the company said it was hit with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe over its prostate cancer treatment.

Telix’s shares slid 10.3% to A$22.530 lagging a 0.7% rise in theASX 200index.

Telix said on Tuesday that the SEC had issued it with a subpoena regarding the company’s disclosures of its prostate cancer therapies stating that it was a “fact-finding request.” More information on the probe was not disclosed and the company said it was cooperating with the agency.

“We cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or what (if any) action the SEC may take following the conclusion of this investigation” Telix said in a statement adding that the company will continue with the clinical development of its prostate cancer treatments.

The company said that the probe does not extend to its commercial and late-stage treatments.

News of the probe largely offset strong second-quarter earnings from the pharma firm which clocked a 63% jump in revenue. The company also reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance of $770 million to $800 million.

Asia stocks rise Nikkei soars to 1-yr high on US-Japan trade deal,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday with Japan’s Nikkei 225 rallying to a one-year high after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the country which will entail lower trade tariffs.

But broader gains in regional markets were somewhat quashed by weakness in technology shares which fell tracking overnight losses in their U.S. peers especially chipmakers.

Still theS&P 500eked out a record high on Tuesday whileS&P 500 Futuresrose 0.2% in Asian trade.

TheNikkei 225index andTOPIXindexes traded about 2.7% higher by 22:08 ET (02:08 GMT) after initially advancing over 3%. Both indexes reached their strongest level since July 2024.

Trump said in a social media post that his administration had signed a “massive” trade deal with Japan setting U.S. tariffs on the country at 15% which is lower than the 25% threatened earlier. Trump also said that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and will open its markets to more U.S. automobiles and agricultural products.

A host of reports also showed that Trump will lower his automobile tariffs to 15% for 25% for Japanese firms but will maintain his steel and aluminum tariffs at 50%.

Japanese automakers were the best performers on the Nikkei with majorsToyotaMotor (NYSE:TM) Corp (TYO:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (TYO:7267) both rallying as much as 10%.

The U.S. trade deal brings some much-needed clarity for Japanese exporters although the 15% tariff is still expected to present some headwinds for external demand.

Still news of the trade deal helped investors look past heightened political uncertainty in Japan after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s party suffered a bruising defeat in recent upper house elections.

Broader Asian stocks mostly advanced on Wednesday as optimism over the Japan agreements spurred bets that more countries will sign deals with Washington before an August 1 deadline.

But tech shares specifically chipmakers fell tracking overnight losses in their U.S. peers. Weak current-quarter guidance from Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) also weighed as did a recent report that Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.

Japan shares rally after Trump announces trade deal,"Investing.com-- Japan’sNikkei 225andTOPIXindexes rose sharply in early trade on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo which will subject the latter to a 15% tariff.

The Nikkei 225 benchmark rose as much as 2.2% to a three-week high of 40667.0 points while the TOPIX rose over 2% to a one-year high of 2890.08 points.

Automakers were by far the best performers on the Nikkei withToyotaMotor (NYSE:TM) Corp (TYO:7203) the world’s biggest automaker by sales up 7.6%.

Ltd.(TYO:7201) andYamaha Motor Co Ltd(TYO:7272) rose between 6% and 10%.

Trump’s 15% levy is lower than his earlier threats of a 25% duty offering some relief to Japanese markets. Local media reports also said that Japanese automakers will face  a 15% tariff which is smaller than Trump’s 25% tariff on the sector.

The U.S. trade deal comes just hours after Japan’s top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa met Trump at the White House on Tuesday. But the 15% tariff is still higher than Japan’s earlier demands that it be exempt from all U.S. tariffs.

Still a relatively smaller U.S. levy offers some relief to Japanese exporters especially automakers who were facing increased headwinds in the U.S. due to higher import costs.

While majors such as Toyota and Honda have production facilities in America they still export several popular models and auto parts to the country making them subject to U.S. duties.

Among other sectors Nippon Steel Corp (TYO:5401) rose 3% on hopes that the company will also be exempt from Trump’s 50% tariffs on all steel imports. It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s 15% levy will be compounded with his sectoral tariffs although the president has in the past signaled that his reciprocal tariffs on major economies will supersede his sectoral tariffs.",,,,,

Trump tariffs interest rate caution persists

While the Wall Street indices did hit a series of record highs over the past week the pace of gains was seen slowing in recent sessions amid persistent caution over Trump’s tariffs and uncertainty over the future path of interest rates.

Trump has outlined tariff rates ranging from 20% to 50% against major U.S. trading partners all of which are set to take effect from August 1. The president also imposed a 50% duty oncopperimports and threatened a 200% duty on pharmaceuticals.

This left markets on edge over the inflationary impact of Trump’s tariffs especially given that the Fed has cited the tariffs as its main motivation behind keeping interest rates unchanged in the near-term.

The Fed is set to meet next week and is widely expected to leave rates unchanged once more even amid persistent criticism from Trump and his allies.

Jerome Powell is set to speak at a Fed conference in Washington D.C. later Tuesday although it remains unclear whether the Fed chair will comment on monetary policy given that the address comes during the Fed’s blackout period before its end-July meeting.

Seaport downgrades MGM lifts Macau casino forecasts as Las Vegas outlook weakens,"Investing.com -- Seaport Research downgraded MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) to Neutral given a slowdown in Las Vegas and limited upside after a strong run in Macau stocks even as it raised its Macau gaming forecasts and estimates for several companies.

Macau’s casino industry has shown stronger-than-expected momentum in the second quarter with Seaport now expecting gross gaming revenue (GGR) to grow 7% for the full year and over 9% in the second half.The firm said sentiment toward China has improved despite lingering macro concerns helped by stimulus and recent gains in tourism.

While Macau-focused stocks remain below pre-pandemic valuation levels Seaport noted that investor attention will shift to the sustainability of recent growth.It raised price targets across most of its coverage except for MGM which it sees under pressure from slower U.S. demand and rising capital spending tied to projects in New York and Japan.

TD Cowen downgrades Valero saying stock reflects overly bullish refining outlook,"Investing.com -- TD Cowen downgradedValero Energy(NYSE:VLO) to Hold from Buy warning that the stock now reflects an overly optimistic outlook for refining margins even as it raised its price target to $140 from $118.

Shares of Valero up 19% year-to-date have rallied sharply over the past few years and are now pricing in near-record earnings levels.The firm estimates current valuation implies EBITDA of about $7.30 per barrel—levels surpassed only during the 2022-23 spike driven by the Russia-Ukraine war.

“We see potential for stabilization-to-downside from here given bullishness reflected in the stock and limited underlying earnings growth” the analysts wrote. There is limited underlying earnings growth and expectations of weaker refining margins in the second half due to seasonal pressures and a likely slowdown in diesel strength.

TD Cowen’s mid-cycle forecast assumes Valero earns $6.90 per barrel in refining EBITDA slightly above its 2015–19 average factoring in improved capture rates and the closure of the Benicia refinery.

While acknowledging Valero’s strong share repurchase program could support free cash flow per share the brokerage said investors tend to focus more on near-term market dynamics in valuing refiners.It expects global refining capacity to rise by 500000 barrels per day annually outside China enough to keep supply and demand in balance over time.",,,,,
Blue Orca Capital takes short position in Nutex Health,"Investing.com -- Short-seller Blue Orca Capital announced Tuesday it has taken a short position on Nutex Health Inc. citing concerns about the company’s billing practices.

Blue Orca claims Nutex’s share price has increased more than 20 times after the company began submitting most patient bills through the arbitration process outlined in the No Surprises Act (NSA) using a third-party vendor identified as HaloMD.

According to Blue Orca HaloMD is run by a former Las Vegas entertainer and reality TV contestant. The short-seller points to three recent federal lawsuits alleging HaloMD engaged in a ""coordinated fraudulent scheme"" to take millions from insurance companies on behalf of healthcare billing clients.

While Nutex is not named in these lawsuits Blue Orca suggests the alleged conduct could explain what it describes as Nutex’s ""recent tripling of revenue per hospital visit.""

The short-seller warns Nutex may face litigation risk including potential clawback of arbitration awards already paid. Blue Orca predicts that if Nutex can no longer use the NSA arbitration system to receive what it calls ""unsustainably high reimbursement rates"" the company’s stock could significantly decline.",,,,,

Goldman Sachs bullish on Liberty Formula One on shareholder payouts,"Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of Liberty Formula One with a Buy rating and a $120 price target saying the company is well positioned to grow earnings and return cash to shareholders over the next few years.

While the stock is not cheap trading at higher multiples than peers Goldman said the premium is justified given the company’s exposure to long-term trends in sports media and strong cash flow potential.A re-rating of the stock could follow if Liberty delivers on growth targets clarifies its plans for MotoGP and starts returning capital to shareholders.",,,,,

European stocks mostly lower on trade uncertainties; earnings season continues,"Investing.com - European stocks mostly declined on Tuesday on lingering tariff uncertainties while investors continued to wade through a deluge of quarterly corporate earnings.

TheDAX indexin Germany dropped 1.1% theCAC 40in France slipped 0.7% while theFTSE 100in the U.K. rose 0.1%.

European investors have been on edge since U.S. President Donald Trump announced earlier in July that he would impose a 30% tariff on goods imported from the EU starting Aug. 1.

The two sides have been in negotiations but the deadline is rapidly approaching with no trade deal in sight.

The European bloc has been pushing for Washington to agree to maintain a baseline 10% duty but the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials told the EU’s trade chief last week that they expect Trump to demand more concessions including a baseline tariff of 15% or higher.

With this in mind a growing number of European Union member states including Germany are considering using wide-ranging ""anti-coercion"" measures targeting U.S. services if the EU cannot reach a trade deal Reuters reported citing comments from EU diplomats.

Ahead of that August deadline investors will be studying a series of quarterly corporate earnings parsing through the numbers for any clues on the impact trade uncertainty has had on profitability and consumer demand.

Additionally investors will be looking at how much the euro’s rise has eaten into profits of the firms in the bloc’s export-reliant economy after the single currency surged 9% in the April-June quarter.

Lindt & Spruengli (SIX:LISN) raised its organic sales growth forecast for 2025 to between 9% and 11% from previous guidance of 7% to 9% with the Swiss chocolate maker citing consumer loyalty and a trend towards more premium products.

Swiss lenderJulius Baer(SIX:BAER) missed expectations for first half net profit which fell 35% on the year as the results reflected a previously disclosed increase in loan loss provisions as well as a charge from the sale of its Brazilian wealth management business.

U.K. facilities group Mitie (LON:MTO) reported a strong start to its fiscal year with revenue from the first quarter of FY26 revenue rising 10.1% year-on-year helped by new contract wins project delivery and pricing.

The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe on Tuesday and the main focus will be on the European Central Bank’s next policy decision later in the week.

Analysts widely expect theECBto keep its key deposit rate steady at 2%.

At its last meeting in June policymakers bolstered by signs of flagging inflation and tepid economic activity in the 20-member eurozone slashed rates by 25 basis points.

It was the eighth reduction in a year although it came with an indication from the ECB that it would likely pause in July largely due to uncertainty around trade tensions with Washington.

Oil prices fell Tuesday on fears the increasingly likely trade war between the European Union and the U.S. two major consumers will hit economic activity and thus crude demand.

Baird upgrades STMicroelectronics on cycle recovery margin rebound,"Investing.com -- Baird upgraded STMicroelectronics to Outperform and raised its price target to $50 given improving gross margins signs of a bottom in silicon carbide (SiC) revenue and a clearer path to recovery in smartphones industrial and automotive markets.

The firm lifted its second-half 2025 and 2026 estimates pointing to easing comps and stronger product mix. Gross margin improvement is expected to accelerate in the third quarter as the impact from earlier fab shutdowns fades and utilization rates rise.Baird noted a 170-basis-point margin drag in Q2 from yield recovery should be fully offset by Q4.

STMicro’s ongoing transition to 300mm wafer production which made up 42% of output in 2024 and is projected to reach 57% by 2027 is seen driving structural cost improvements. Capex as a share of revenue is also set to decline offering a depreciation tailwind.

Smartphone-related revenue is expected to get a lift in the second half of 2025 with several hundred million dollars in incremental sales tied to higher content wins.SiC revenue which bottomed in Q1 is poised for a 2026 rebound aided by a joint venture with Sanan Optoelectronics and new design wins with BYD (SZ:002594) and Geely in China EVs.Market share at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains stable in the low 50% range.

Baird also sees upside in data center applications where STMicro is supplying edge AI and power components and in satellite where it is the sole source supplier to SpaceX.

Risks include currency volatility softening consumer demand and persistent channel inventories. But at less than 11x 2027 EPS estimates Baird said STMicro’s valuation remains compelling amid early signs of a broader cycle recovery.",,,,,
Deep-dive into Meta’s AI strategy,"Investing.com -- MoffettNathanson reaffirmed its Buy rating on Meta and raised its price target from $605 to $810 per share in a note Tuesday citing a stronger advertising outlook and weakening U.S. dollar as tailwinds for future earnings.

The analysts took a critical but measured look at the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) strategy and ongoing investments in Reality Labs.

“From 2019 to 2025 we estimate that Meta’s Reality Labs will have generated over $12 billion in aggregate revenues on the back of $100 billion in aggregate expenses” MoffettNathanson wrote.

Despite the “-$88 billion in aggregate losses” the firm noted that Meta’s stock has significantly outperformed theS&P 500since rebranding from Facebook (NASDAQ:META).

“With all the whirlwind action that Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has recently taken to re-invigorate their GenAI product momentum we once again find ourselves at another such jumping off point” the analysts said.

They added “While it hasn’t been wise or profitable to doubt the judgement of Zuckerberg at some point efficient markets start to ask about returns on invested capital.”

The firm said Meta’s core advertising business “will continue to generate enough earnings power to hold the market’s interest” supported in part by AI enhancements.

As a result MoffettNathanson raised its 2025 earnings and revenue forecasts and also increased its 2026 and 2027 revenue estimates to reflect “incremental gains from Meta’s AI investments.”

Still the analysts cautioned that the long-term financial impact of Meta’s recent “zealous push into AI Superintelligence” remains unclear.

“To be clear should macro conditions deteriorate or advertising growth slow the market’s patience will likely be tested and as we saw in 2022 that might not be a pretty picture” the firm said.",,,,,
