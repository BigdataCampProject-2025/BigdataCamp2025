Home sales declined in June as prices hit new all-time high,Sales of existing homes dropped more than expected in June the latest sign that record-high prices and elevated mortgage rates are extending the housing market’s deep freezeYahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports. Boston writes: Read the full story here. After jumping in May sales last month fell 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.93 million according to National Association of Realtors data released on Wednesday. Sales came in worse than expected; economists had forecast a smaller decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million homes. Spring is historically the busiest time of year for home sales but all signs point to 2025 being another subdued year. June sales typically reflect homes that went under contract in April or May — the market’s busy period. But mortgage rates have remained in the high 6% area for much of the year while prices hit a new record straining affordability for buyers even when the labor market and economy look healthy.
The meme stock rally continues the Trump trade rebound that has stocks trading at record highs,"Meme stocksare running wild again. Some of thelatest highfliers— Krispy Kreme (DNUT) Opendoor (OPEN) and Kohl's (KSS) — all have one key thing in common: They are heavily shorted stocks. This means investors have been betting the next price move for these names will be lower and some strategists suggest that this week's meme surge is merely the latest pillar of a consistent theme during the S&P 500's 25% rally over the last three months. ""A lot of what has outperformed significantly [since the market bottom] obviously the memes but the heavily shorted stocks of every variety"" Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.

Short sellers have lost just shy of $355 billion since the market bottom on April 8 according to data from S3 Partners. That includes more than $100 billion in lossessince Yahoo Finance last published S3's data on May 22. Read more here."

Trump readies new hands-off AI 'action plan',"President Trump isexpected to releasean AI ""action plan"" on Wednesday said to outline how the US can win in the global AI race by taking a hands-off regulatory approach. The plan is likely to cover how to make it easier to export AI technology and to lower barriers to domestic development going by a draftreported by Reuters. A clutch of supporting executive orders expected this week could include one that could draw legal challenges notes Yahoo Finance'sAlexis Keenan: Read more here. There may be an order that targets ""woke AI"" according to The Wall Street Journal. It would target AI developers that the administration believes create liberally biased algorithms and block them from serving as federal contractors. ... Two constitutional law scholars who talked with Yahoo Finance said it is doubtful the ""woke AI"" measure will withstand legal scrutiny. ""If you sanction software that is liberal but not software that is conservative the challenge will be that the executive order is content-based discrimination"" said UC San Francisco School of Law professorRory Little. ... But the order's constitutional viability may not matter in the short term for companies like Amazon (AMZN) Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) Google (GOOG) OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) Microsoft (MSFT) and Perplexity (PEAI.PVT) all of which are vying to supply AI systems to the government. Even if the order is met with legal challenges AI developers might not have time to wait out a court solution. ""A lot of people are trying to make deals with the Trump administration so they view these executive orders not as law but as the opening bid in a negotiation"" Little said."

How the dropping dollar could scramble Trump's agenda,"President Trump has said he is ""never going to let the dollar slide."" But his agenda is making that complicated Yahoo Finance'sBen Werschkulreports: Read more here. President Trump and his aides are closely watching the US dollar's (DX=F) drop over the first six months of this year as they track a change that could have wide-ranging effects from how tariffs are felt to Federal Reserve policy to America's role in the world. The question which notably remains a somewhat open one even among Trump's aides is whether the net effects may include at least some positive short-term consequences for the president's agenda or whether the dollar needs to be strengthened at all costs. ... The currency's moves so far this year — which have surprised some economists who expected Trump's tariffs to put pressure in the other direction — could indeed boost exports but could also complicate Trump's goals for the coming months primarily by pushing prices up for US consumers of foreign goods. Trump himself remains very much in the strong dollar camp as hereiterated just a few days ago saying that he is ""never going to let the dollar slide."" The only way that could happen he added is ""if you have a dummy"" as president. The somewhat mixed messaging comes asthe US dollar index(DX-Y.NYB) — a measure of the US currency against various foreign currencies — has fallen significantly and is now down almost 10% since Inauguration Day."

The protein boom is only beginning,"Yahoo Finance'sHamza Shabanreports in today'sMorning Brief: Read more here. They're cramming it into everything now. It's in pancakes and pasta chips and cereal. Plant-based or harvested from the farm it's the macro(nutrient) of the moment. And slices of corporate America are not so subtly asking: Have you met your protein goal today? Protein Doritos sounds like the ideal mashup for the gym rat snack fiends of the world. But it's not as farfetched a product as you might think. Pepsi (PEP) plans to unveil new protein offerings for some of its Frito-Lay and Quaker brands part of a broader shift to enhance their products and strip away artificial flavors and colors. (But what is a tasty Cheeto if not a brazenly synthetic delight?) Pepsi's intended relaunch and extension of popular brands is a reaction to a consumer base on the hunt for healthier cleaner options. Executives across the food and beverage worldsee a potential crisis unfolding. As demand for legacy products wavers companies are reaching for new lines (like fiber prebiotics hydration energy and protein)to support the core business. ""Protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast"" said PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta on an earnings call last week. ""Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case a few months back a few years back."

The company is among the first US solar companies to report earnings this quarter. ...

But the stock is still down about 17% year to date. Yahoo Finance'sPras Subramanianpreviews three key areas to watch when the EV maker reports: Read more here. The core:Tesla's bread and butter despite Musk's embrace of a robot-driven future is its core auto business. That drives the huge majority of revenue and profit at Tesla. The company is expected to report second quarter revenue of $22.79 billion per Bloomberg estimates a 9% drop compared with the $25.05 billion reported a year ago. From a profitability standpoint Wall Street analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $0.43 translating to adjusted net income of $1.513 billion down slightly from a year ago. Robotaxi rollout:On the bright side for Tesla is Elon Musk's big bet on the future with robotaxis. Tesla and Musk will most likely focus on that business and this may perhaps point to future rollout plans with more cars and regions. ""The earnings call also presents an opportunity for Tesla's robotaxi/AV narrative to shine which has been front and center of Tesla stock's strength"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to investors. ""We could see Elon Musk potentially discussing fleet growth targets or expansion plans."" Where's the cheap EV?A year ago Tesla said in its Q2 earnings report that production remains on track for new vehicles likely including a cheaper EV in the first half of next year. Investors and analysts are still waiting. There has been no indication or even renderings of a new vehicle let alone production of a vehicle priced around $30000. Tesla's cheapest EV is the rear-wheel-drive Model 3 sedan which starts at around $43000 without incentives. Investors are keen to hear more about the development of the long-awaited cheaper EV that Tesla has promised along with other new vehicles that the company said would allow it to return to a 50% growth rate compared to 2023."
