Trump readies new hands-off AI 'action plan' that offers a split with Biden,President Trump is expected to release an AI "action plan" on Wednesday that reportedly outlines how the US can win in the global race to develop artificial intelligence by fostering a hands-off regulatory approach to the technology.Media reports suggest the document will likely mark a split from Biden administration policies which favored restrictions against exports of AI chips and steps to ensure AI was not used to spread misinformation.The White House according to a Reuters report that cited a summary of the draft action plan will likely discuss how to make it easier to export AI technology abroad and reduce barriers to its development in the US.That may include everything from faster permitting for building AI data centers to more use of AI at the Pentagon to identifying which federal regulations slow down AI and even withholding federal funding from states with tough AI laws already in place.Trump is expected to discuss the topic during a speech at a Wednesday event titled "Winning the AI Race" organized by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and his co-hosts on the "All-In" podcast.The strategy announcement from the White House is the outcome of an order Trump signed in his first week that asked for an AI action plan to "sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing economic competitiveness and national security."FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on AI in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington U.S. January 23 2025.

(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo) Â· Reuters / ReuterSome executive orders are also expected this week according to Axios and the Wall Street Journal that would promote the exports of chips and AI technology to countries considered friendly to the US.There may be an order that targets "woke AI" according to The Wall Street Journal. It would target AI developers that the administration believes create liberally biased algorithms and block them from serving as federal contractors.The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.Two constitutional law scholars who talked with Yahoo Finance said it is doubtful the "woke AI" measure will withstand legal scrutiny."If you sanction software that is liberal but not software that is conservative the challenge will be that the executive order is content-based discrimination" said UC San Francisco School of Law professor Rory Little.
